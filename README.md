# ARDrone_cpp_interface
C++ interface to control the Parrot ARDrone v1 through a Wi-Fi connection. Implemented for Unix (tested in Ubuntu 14.04). Robotics project (November 2015)

Check the main file for an example of how to use the interface.

Code in /control was written by Karl Leplat (not me) mostly in C. I use it as a library but do not know exactly how it works or whether it is well written. It does compile and work, though.
